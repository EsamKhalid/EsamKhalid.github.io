                    <p>
                        This project started out as a passion project which I had planned to do on the side in my free time,
                        however as talks started about the coursework, I decided to use the small base I had developed and build up on that
                        instead of starting a new project from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was made in <a href="https://unity.com" target="_blank">Unity</a> and coded in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="_blank">C#</a> ,I had taught myself how to use the game engine and code in C#, as we 
                        only learnt python in sixth form meaning I was on my own and had to do my own research and practice using the game
                        engine and programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project is an aim trainer targeted towards those who play first person shooter(FPS) games competitively,
                        it is meant to help practice aiming and different skills related to aiming, it had 2 different game modes,
                        settings pages, customisation and feedback using data collected from the users performance in order
                        to help them improve their aim and see where they were going wrong and how they can fix it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was accompanied by a 115 page write up which explained the thought, research and development stages
                        of the project and how I went from just and idea, all the way to a finished project. It was made in 3 prototype
                        stages where I would make, test and fix each prototype before moving onto the next.
